Students with profiles on this website will be pursuing a variety of different types of education within the following two categories:</p>
				<p><h4>Traditional Programs</h4></p>
					Students pursuing more traditional 2 year, 4 year or graduate programs will fall under this category.
				<p><h4>Non-Traditional Programs</h4>
					Students pursuing certificates, vocational degrees, workshops and conferences will fall under this category.</p>
					
				<p><h5>Accomplishments:</h5> We have raised x amount scholarship money of in the past year.</p>
				<p><h5>Goals:</h5> In the next year, we plan to raise x amount of funding for students in the area and to expand our student base to the entire Pacific Northwest.</p>
